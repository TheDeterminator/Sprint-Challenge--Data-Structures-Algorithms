Exercise I:
  a) There are at least two reasons that we can see that runtime complexity is
  O(n) first we have a bound of n^3 that we are incrementing to by steps of
  n^2. This is equivalent to divding n^3 by n^2 which is equal to n. Secondly
  an analysis of the outputs of this funciton for several values n shows that
  the function takes n number of operations to complete. For these reasons
  we conclude that our runtime complexity is O(n)

  b) Because we are dealing with one operation inside of nested for loops that whose ranges are bounded
  by n we conclude that the runtime complexity is O(n^3). Looking analyzing the output
  of this function would also help us to conclude that

  c) This is a recursive functions whose depth relies on n for this reason we
  conclude that the runtime complexity is O(c^n), exponential
